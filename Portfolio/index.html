    -   Website:        Jeremy Whiteside's portfolio (webdesign4.georgianc.on.ca/~200249654/portfolio/)
    -   Description:    This is my personal portfolio that I made for assignment 1 in my advanced web dev class.
    -                   It is a single-page website, and all navigation is handled through scrolling.
    -                   I chose a single-page website over a multiple-paged website because I have not 
    -                   made a single-page website before, and wanted to try my hand at it.  I learned some new things
    -                   and think I pulled it off fairly well.  I started out with a very specific and defined idea of what I wanted
    -                   my site to look like.  I ran into alot of problems along the way, and ended up making many small changes to my design,
    -                   until I eventually settled on the current design.  The current design looks similar to my old design, but only if you squint
    -                   and tilt your head about 30 degrees to the right.

                        I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.
                        To write code is my real test, compiling is my cause.
                        I will travel across the web, searching far and wide;
                        teaching myself to understand the java API. Gotta code it all.

Jesus was the greatest teacher, and I strive to be like him.  For this reason, I live to help others. Helping people gives me a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else can.
                        Through helping people, I want to make the world a better place.  While I probably won&#39t find a cure for a disease, or end any wars in my lifetime, I am certain that I will have made a positive difference in many people&#39s lives.  When I die I safely say that I contributed to society and didn&#39t make any enemies.

                    <p>
                        Finding creative solutions to problems also brings me much satisfaction.  I have always loved building things, solving puzzles, and math.  Programming combines these three activities.  I am thankful that I can pursue something that brings me happiness as a career, and am fortunate enough to have discovered it early
                        My dad is the reason why I love technology.  He is a computer programmer, and sparked my interest in computers at a very young age.

                    <p>
                        I am also passionate about music.  I have a strong base in piano, but have also picked up a few other instruments along the way.  I completed my grade 7 piano certification with the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2012, and then shifted my focus towards electronic music, which I now compose in my spare time.  I enjoy all types of music, but
