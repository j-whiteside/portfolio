                        I want to make the world a better place.  While I probably won’t find a cure for a disease, or end any wars in my lifetime, I am certain that I will have made a positive difference in many people’s lives.  When I die I safely say that I contributed to society and didn’t make any enemies.

                        Finding creative solutions to problems also brings me much satisfaction.  I have always loved building things, solving puzzles, and math.  Programming combines these three activities.  I am thankful that I can pursue something that brings me happiness as a career, and am fortunate enough to have discovered it early
                        My dad is the reason why I love technology.  He is a computer programmer, and sparked my interest in computers at a very young age.

                        I am also passionate about music.  I have a strong base in piano, but have also picked up a few other instruments along the way.  I completed my grade 7 piano certification with the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2012, and then shifted my focus towards electronic music, which I now compose in my spare time.  I enjoy all types of music, but
